The intial data was two tables of firm data and manager data. The data was cleaned and merged in Tableau Prep and then outpout as csv.

Analysis
The analyis comprises of multiple sheet tabs depicting different components of the analysis and an interactive dashboard in the end brings it all together. Pivot tables and pivot charts are used for the analysis, except for only one sheet that uses a tree map.

The analysis looks into total assests in each company, Year on Year net income by ticker, total compensation by ticker, salary by manager, and a tree map of total compensation by manager. The dashboard combines all four pivot charts and uses slicers to provide interactivity to the users.
